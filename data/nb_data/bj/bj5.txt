Anthony works in the grocery store
savin’ his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door,
she said
“Sonny, move out to the country”
Workin’ too hard can give me
a heart attack
You oughta know by now
Who needs a house out in Hackensack?
Is that what you get with your money?

*It seems such a waste of time
If that’s what it’s all about
If that’s movin’ up then I’m movin’ out.

Sergeant O’Leary is walkin’ the beat
At night he becomes a bartender
He works at Mister Cacciatore’s down
on Sullivan Street
Across from the medical center
He’s tradin’ in his Chevy for a Cadillac
You oughta know by now
And if he can’t drive with
a broken back
At least he can polish the fenders

*It seems such a waste of time
If that’s what it’s all about
If that’s movin’ up then I’m movin’ out.

You should never argue with a crazy mind
You oughta know by now
You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime
Is that all you get for your money?

*It seems such a waste of time
If that’s what it’s all about
If that’s movin’ up then I’m 
movin’ out.
